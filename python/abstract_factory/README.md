### Abstract Factory
The `Abstract Factory` is a **Creational** design pattern used to create a family of related or dependent objects without specifying their exact classes. This pattern provides an interface or abstract class for constructing a set of products, allowing the client to interact with these products without being tied to their concrete implementations. The primary distinction from the Factory Method lies in its focus: Abstract Factory emphasizes the production of a group of objects rather than a single specific object type. This pattern offers significant flexibility in managing complex systems with diverse product families.

#### Core Components of Abstract Factory
- **Abstract Factory:** An interface or abstract class that defines creation methods for producing various types of related products. This interface specifies which products should be created, delegating the implementation details to subclasses.  
- **Concrete Factory:** Concrete implementations of the Abstract Factory responsible for producing a specific set of products. Each Concrete Factory constructs a distinct family of objects (e.g., a ground delivery set or an air delivery set).  
- **Abstract Product:** Interfaces or abstract classes representing each product type within the family, defining their features and behaviors.  
- **Concrete Product:** Specific implementations of the Abstract Product, instantiated by the Concrete Factories.  

#### Use Cases for Abstract Factory
**Need for Related Families:** When a system requires the creation of a set of related objects (e.g., different UI components for various operating systems).  
**Implementation Independence:** When the client should remain unaware of the details of object creation and interact solely through interfaces.  
Support for Variety: When the system must accommodate multiple product families (e.g., ground, air, or sea delivery) with potential for future expansion.  

#### Differences from Factory Method
The **Factory Method** focuses on creating a single type of object, whereas the Abstract Factory produces an entire collection or family of objects.  
The **Abstract Factory** typically leverages multiple Factory Methods internally to generate its range of products.
