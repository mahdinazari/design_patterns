### Adapter Design Pattern  
The Adapter design pattern is a `Structural pattern` used to make two incompatible interfaces work together. It acts as an intermediary, enabling a class or object with an interface that is not directly compatible with a system to interact with it by converting or adapting the interface. In other words, the Adapter translates the interface of an existing class into the interface expected by the client, without requiring modifications to the original class’s code. This pattern can be implemented in two main forms: Class Adapter (using inheritance) and Object Adapter (using composition).

#### Core Components of Adapter
**Target:** The interface that the client interacts with and expects the object in use to conform to.  
**Adaptee:** An existing class or object with a different interface that needs to be adapted to align with the Target.  
**Adapter:** A class that implements the Target interface and, by utilizing the Adaptee, translates the client’s requests into a format understandable by the Adaptee.

#### Use Cases for Adapter
Compatibility with Legacy Systems: When you need to utilize an old codebase or library with an interface that differs from the current system.  
**Integration with Third-Party Libraries:** When an external API’s interface does not match your system, and you cannot modify its code.  
**Flexibility in Interactions:** When you want to adapt existing classes to new interfaces without altering their original code.

#### Advantages
Enables reuse of existing code without modification.  
Separates the client’s interface from the actual implementation.  

#### Differences from Other Patterns
Unlike the Decorator pattern, which adds functionality, the Adapter focuses solely on interface adaptation.  
Unlike the Facade pattern, which provides a simplified interface to a subsystem, the Adapter is designed specifically to reconcile two distinct interfaces.  
This pattern is particularly valuable in projects dealing with heterogeneous or legacy systems, where compatibility is a key concern.
